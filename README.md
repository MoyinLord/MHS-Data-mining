# INTRODUCTION

Maternal health is a critical aspect of women's well-being during pregnancy, childbirth, and the
postpartum period. Tragically, in 2017, approximately 295,000 women lost their lives due to pregnancyrelated complications. The primary causes of these maternal deaths were attributed to issues like
bleeding, infections, and high blood pressure. Additionally, indirect factors such as anemia and malaria
also contributed to the mortality rate. However, it is essential to recognize that a significant portion of
these deaths can be prevented through proper prenatal and antenatal care.
As data scientists collaborating with healthcare professionals, our focus is on studying blood pressure in
pregnant women. We have access to a dataset containing various health parameters, including age,
heart rate, and blood pressure readings. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to gain valuable insights into
maternal health and identify potential risk factors and associations that can impact pregnancy
outcomes.
Our ultimate goal is to leverage the findings from this analysis to contribute to the improvement of
maternal health care. By understanding the factors that influence blood pressure during pregnancy, we
can develop more targeted and effective interventions to ensure safer pregnancies and childbirth
experiences for women around the world. This work holds the potential to save lives and make a
meaningful impact on maternal health outcomes globally.
